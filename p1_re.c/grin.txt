Q5. For the three longest words, do I have to print them out, the longest,
        the second longest, and the third longest, in that order?
A5. The project description only says "The top three longest words", so you
        can print them out in any order. In addition, if there is a tie, you
        can break the tie anyway you like.

Q4. If there is a blank line in the file, will that line be considered the
        shortest?
A4. Yes. That will be the shortest (or one of the shortest). An empty line
        has 1 character ('\n') and 0 word.

Q3. For the simulated grep command, if someone inputs a string such as 'in'
        should the program only output the lines that have the word 'in'
        or anything with the string 'in' such as a line like "anything
        is possible"?
A3. It is the latter case. Any line that has a substring matches the input
        string should be printed out.
    If a line has multiple matches, that line should be printed out only once.
